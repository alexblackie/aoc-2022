# Advent of Code 2k22: My Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions for the [Advent of Code for 2022][aoc].

## Running

This year I decided to use C, so all the solutions here are written in GNU-ish
C, with a simple Makefile to get everything compiled.

To compile everything, just run:

```
$ make
```

and you'll get a `./build` directory full of executables.

If you want to build just a specific day's solution, you can specify:

```
$ make build/day2
```
